Guides for getting things done, programming well, and programming in style.

* [Code Review](/code-review#code-review)
* [Style](/style)
  * [Objective-C](/style/objective-c#objective-c-style-guide)
  * [Swift](/style/objective-c#objective-c-style-guide)
  * [Ruby](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#prelude)
  * [Rails](https://github.com/bbatsov/rails-style-guide#prelude)
  * [Java](/style/java#java-style)

High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

If you disagree with a guideline, open an issue on the guides repo rather than debating it within the
code review. In the meantime, apply the guideline.
